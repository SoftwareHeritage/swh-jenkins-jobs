            Allow skipping the crates publication when true. False by default to
            actually publish crates and/or python modules. Crates being immutable, if we
            trigger multiple times the rust-incoming-tag job, that step will
            subsequently (once a first successful publication occurred).
      - bool:
          name: DRY_RUN
          default: false
          description: |
            Execute the job as usual but avoid publishing crates or python module.
            Default to false. This can be set to true mostly for debugging purposes.
